# Updated for net6.0
This library has been updated to net6.0 by Jonko.

# Gota's Sound/IO (Original Description)
A library I use to manage reading and writing binary files, and also have some utilities to convert and play some streamed audio files. A lot of reader and writer code was taken from Syroot.BinaryData.
